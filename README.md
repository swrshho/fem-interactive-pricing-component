this is my solution to frontend mentor's pricing component challange

Hello to anyone that is reading this document.

This repo is my solution to frontend mentor's pricing component challange.

The layout of this challange was pretty simple, and it has nothing special.
the main challange here i think was the javascript although i had a hard time with the slider because it was my first time.
the solution that i came up with is the best that i could, cnsidering my knowledge and exprience.
i'm sure that there are a lot of better ways to do the javascript, but this is currently my best.

i learned a lot about sliders and also gained some good knowledge about jquerry.
